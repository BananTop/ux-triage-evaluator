Travelling with a family with multiple passes, the boarding pass in app was one of the best features. Now there's Wallet 1 by 1 and that is failing with an error. It was so easy to change flights before. Presumably someone has decided to save costs by only having a website to maintain but you may as well not have an app in that case! it's now quicker to download passes to Wallet from the website..",

The new App is sluggish, counter-intuitive, and honestly just flat out broken. easyJet, if you care a jot about your customer experience, please roll back the app to the old version because the current experience is terrible.",
